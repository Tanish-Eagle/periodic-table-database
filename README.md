# periodic-table-database

A periodic table database, implemented using PostgreSQL. The database has the information about the elements such as atomic number, atomic mass, type such as metal or nonmetal, boiling point, melting point, and the symbol of the element.

A Bash script is created to access this database, which takes either a symbol, atomic number, and attomic mass as an argument, and provides the information of that element.
